# Hill Cipher
A Cryptogtaphy based project involving **Hill Cipher** and **Linear Transformations**.

## Key Takeaways
- Enciphering & Deciphering
- Modular Arithmetic
- Linear Transformations
- Hill n-cipher
- Digraphs

## Concept
### *Encryption*
To perform encryption:
- Convert the input string into a vector.
- Produce a random non-singular encryption key matrix.
- Use the encryption key matrix to transform the input vector into an encrypted string.

### *Decryption*
To perform decryption:
- Use the concept of **Modular Multiplicative Inverse** of Matrices to obtain the Decryption Key from the Encryption Key.
- Use the obtained Decryption Key to convert the Encrypted Word Vector into its Decrypted counterpart.

*Note: Modulo 26 is used at every stage ~ 26 Alphabets in the English Alphabet*

## How to run
Perform the following steps to run this project:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Create a New Repl (C++).
- Drag and Drop folders (turn by turn) into the Repl - **Note: Drag and Drop only one of the folders (Encryption/Decryption) at a time, as MakeFile causes issues. If you know a workaround, feel free to do so !**
- Run the respective files and provide necessary inputs.

We only have a couple of rules and we hope you enjoy the process :)

## Contributing Rules
1. Don't move or delete any files. Only modify them.
2. Put all Encryption related codes in the **Cipher->Encryption** folder.
3. Put all Decryption related codes in the **Cipher->Decryption** folder.
4. Put all Input and Output Management scripts in the **Cipher->Scripts** folder.

## Contributing Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your forked repository to your computer
3. Head to the issues tab and look for an issue that you like.
4. Once you have decided what issue to work on, give it a shot!
5. Once done, push the code to your forked repository.
6. Head to the Pull Requests tab and click on "Create New Pull Request"
7. On the left of the arrow should be this repo and on the right should be yours.
8. Add a small description to the Pull Request describing what you've done.
9. Mention what Issue you have worked on. If the issue number is #3, you can mention "Closes #3" in the Pull Request description.
