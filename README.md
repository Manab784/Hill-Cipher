# Cryptography-LAA-Project
A Cryptogtaphy based project involving **Hill Cipher** and **Linear Transformations**.

## Key Takeaways
- Enciphering & Deciphering
- Modular Arithmetic
- Linear Transformations
- Hill n-cipher
- Digraphs

## Concept
### *Encryption*
To perform encryption:
- Convert the input string into a vector.
- Produce a random non-singular encryption key matrix.
- Use the encryption key matrix to transform the input vector into an encrypted string.

### *Decryption*
To perform decryption:
- Use the concept of **Modular Multiplicative Inverse** of Matrices to obtain the Decryption Key from the Encryption Key.
- Use the obtained Decryption Key to convert the Encrypted Word Vector into its Decrypted counterpart.

*Note: Modulo 26 is used at every stage ~ 26 Alphabets in the English Alphabet*

## How to run
Perform the following steps to run this project:
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Create a New Repl (C++).
- Drag and Drop folders (turn by turn) into the Repl - **Note: Drag and Drop only one of the folders (Encryption/Decryption) at a time, as MakeFile causes issues. If you know a workaround, feel free to do so !**
- Run the respective files and provide necessary inputs.
