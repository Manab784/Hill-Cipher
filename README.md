# Cryptography-LAA-Project
A Cryptogtaphy based project involving **Hill Cipher** and **Linear Transformations**.

## Key Takeaways
- Enciphering & Deciphering
- Modular Arithmetic
- Linear Transformations
- Hill n-cipher
- Digraphs

## Concept
### *Encryption*
To perform encryption:
- Convert the input string into a vector.
- Produce a random non-singular encryption key matrix.
- Use the encryption key matrix to transform the input vector into an encrypted string.

### *Decryption*
To perform decryption:
- Use the concept of **Modular Multiplicative Inverse** of Matrices to obtain the Decryption Key from the Encryption Key.
- Use the obtained Decryption Key to convert the Encrypted Word Vector into its Decrypted counterpart.

*Note: Modulo 26 is used at every stage ~ 26 Alphabets in the English Alphabet*
